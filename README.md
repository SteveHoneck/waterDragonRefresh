# waterDragonRefresh
Website. Allows users to explore information on Water Dragon lizards. 

Inspired by a personal favorite, but aging, website.  Built with the intention of practicing Bootstrap.

I learned a lot building this site. There are many things I have left to finish and a few changes I would like to make now seeing the almost complete version. Looking back, I would have done the layout differently. The information-heavy accordians would have performed better under a tabbed format.
